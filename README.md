# Comprehensive To-Do List App

This project is a React Native To-Do List application that allows users to create, edit, delete, and manage tasks. The app supports user authentication, offline functionality, data synchronization, responsive design, and other advanced features such as animations, gestures, and API integration.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login and registration with email and password validation.
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete tasks with support for titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority levels.
- **Offline Support**: Save tasks locally and sync data when back online.
- **Weather Integration**: Fetch and display weather information using a public API.
- **Form Validation**: Input validation for both registration and task management forms.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different device sizes and orientations.
- **Animations and Gestures**: Interactive task management with animations and swipe gestures.
- **Error Handling**: Network errors are handled with user feedback and error messages.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) and **npm** or **yarn**
- **React Native CLI** or **Expo CLI** (depending on your environment)
- **Android Studio** or **Xcode** for emulating devices or testing on real devices

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/comprehensive-todo-list-app.git
cd comprehensive-todo-list-app
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```bash
API_HOST=https://your-api-host.com
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
TOKEN_KEY=your_jwt_token_key
```

- Replace `your-api-host.com` with the backend API endpoint (mock API can be used).
- Get the `API_KEY` for weather data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- Set a secure `TOKEN_KEY` for JWT authentication.

### Step 4: Running the App

For **iOS**:

```bash
npm run ios
```

For **Android**:

```bash
npm run android
```

Ensure that you have the necessary emulators or physical devices running.

### Step 5: Running Tests

To run tests, you can use **Jest** and the **React Native Testing Library**. Run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Features Breakdown

### 1. User Authentication

- Users can register and log in using email and password.
- React Navigation is used for routing between the login/registration screens and the main app.
- Authentication status is persisted using React Context for state management.

### 2. Task Management

- Users can create, update, and delete tasks. Each task has a title, description, due date, and priority.
- Redux is used to manage task states, ensuring that all updates are reflected properly.

### 3. Offline Support

- Tasks are stored locally using **AsyncStorage** (or **Realm** as an alternative).
- The app is fully functional offline and synchronizes with the backend once a connection is re-established.

### 4. API Integration

- The home screen fetches and displays weather information based on the user's location using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
- Weather data is updated in real-time, and users can see the current weather conditions.

### 5. Form Validation

- Registration and task creation/editing forms are validated for proper input.
- Forms include checks for valid email format, required fields, and password strength.

### 6. Responsive Design

- The app is responsive and works seamlessly across different screen sizes and orientations.
- Flexbox and StyleSheet are used to create a responsive layout.

### 7. Animations and Gestures

- Swipe gestures are implemented for deleting tasks from the list.
- Animations enhance the user experience when creating, deleting, or updating tasks using the **Animated API** or **Reanimated** library.

### 8. Error Handling

- The app gracefully handles network errors, providing appropriate feedback messages to the user.
- Error states such as failed logins, task synchronization errors, and more are handled with user notifications.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: Core framework for building the app.
- **Redux**: For managing global state and tasks.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend and weather APIs.
- **AsyncStorage** or **Realm**: For offline storage and persistence.
- **React Navigation**: For navigation between different screens.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: To fetch and display weather information.
- **Animated API** or **Reanimated**: For handling animations and gestures.
- **Jest**: For unit and integration tests.
